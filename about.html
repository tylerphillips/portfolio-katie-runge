			<h1>Hey Y'all! </h1>
      

      <h3 class="about-katie">My name is Katie Runge. Here is a little information about me!</h3>

			<p>All my life, I have been creative. What started out, many years ago, as "craft days" with my Nana and frequent trips to A.C. Moore's and other local craft stores has turned into something so much more than I could have ever imagined. My Nana ignited that fire inside of me, as young girl, to create whatever I imagined. It really is a simple principle. When you envision something you want to create, you simply go and create it and follow through until the end result is something that you are completely satisfied with and are happy about.</p>


			<p>I am constantly looking for my next new creation from computer design to paintings to fun little crafts. I love photography and taking pictures of the world around me and everything in it. I also love capturing moments that create lifelong memories. Basically, what it all amounts to is I like to be me. I like to be creative, energetic, and passionate about life and everything it has to offer. Because I always have and always will express myself through art and design and because of my lifelong passion for individuality and creativity, I have decided to make this my career.</p>

			<p>Because of my passion for being creative, and my love of being hands-on, I have furthered my education by attending Clemson University and have pursued my passion in the Graphic Communications department. I have learned so much during my four years in this program, and it has set me up for success in this industry. I am so thankful that I will get to go into the workforce and do what I love. I am making a career out of my passion!</p>

			<p>I hope you enjoy looking at my website and all of my designs. This will be my outlet to express myself and showcase some of my favorite designs that I have created.</p>
